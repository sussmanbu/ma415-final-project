### Info About this Template.

This is a "hello world" example website for the [**blogdown**](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) package. The theme was forked from [@budparr/gohugo-theme-ananke](https://themes.gohugo.io/gohugo-theme-ananke/) and modified by Dan Sussman added MathJax support. Thanks to [Yihui Xie](https://github.com/yihui/) for putting `blogdown` together and for providing the Javascript to use MathJax.
