<p>This comes from the file <code>content/data.Rmd</code>.</p>
<p>Your first steps in this project will be to find data to work on.</p>
<p>I recommend trying to find data that interests you and that you are knowledgeable about. A bad example would be if you have no interest in video games but your data set is about video games. I also recommend finding data that is related to current events, social justice, and other areas that have an impact.</p>
<p>You are <strong>not</strong> allowed to work on COVID data.</p>
<p>Initially, you will find <em>one dataset</em> but later you will need to combine that data with another dataset. For this reason, I recommend finding data that has some date and/or location components. These types of data are conducive to interesting visualizations and analysis and you can also combine this data with other data that also has a date or location variable.
Data from the census, weather data, economic data, are all relatively easy to combine with other data with time/location components.</p>

<h3>Sharing your data</h3>
<p>My recommendation for sharing the data is to not track it on Github unless the data is relatively small &lt;2-3mb.</p>
<p>For small datasets, you can use the <code>dataset</code> folder that is tracked by github. Add the files just like you would any other file.</p>
<p>For larger datasets, you’ll need to create a new folder in the project root directory called <code>dataset-ignore</code>. This will be ignored by git which will help you avoid issues with Github’s size limits. Your team will have to manually make sure the data files in <code>dataset-ignore</code> are synced across team members.</p>
<p>Your <a href="/load_and_clean_data.R">load_and_clean_data.R</a> file is how you will load your data. Here is a an example of a very simple one.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>source(
  here::here(&quot;static&quot;, &quot;load_and_clean_data.R&quot;),
  echo = TRUE # Use echo=FALSE or omit it to avoid code output  
)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 
## &gt; library(tidyverse)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## ── Attaching packages ─────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.3.0 ──</code></pre>
<pre><code>## ✓ ggplot2 3.3.3     ✓ purrr   0.3.4
## ✓ tibble  3.0.5     ✓ dplyr   1.0.3
## ✓ tidyr   1.1.2     ✓ stringr 1.4.0
## ✓ readr   1.4.0     ✓ forcats 0.5.0</code></pre>
<pre><code>## ── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──
## x dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()
## x dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 
## &gt; loan_data &lt;- read_csv(here::here(&quot;dataset&quot;, &quot;loan_refusal.csv&quot;))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 
## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
## cols(
##   bank = col_character(),
##   min = col_double(),
##   white = col_double(),
##   himin = col_double(),
##   hiwhite = col_double()
## )</code></pre>
<p>Note how I use the <code>here::here</code> function to avoid path problems.</p>

<h2>On this page</h2>
<p>You will</p>
<ul>
<li>Describe where/how to find data.
<ul>
<li>You must include a link to the original data source(s).</li>
<li>Why was the data collected/curated? Who put it together? (This is important, if you don’t know why it was collected then that might not be a good dataset to look at.}</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Describe the different data files used and what each variable means.
<ul>
<li>If you have many variables then only describe the most relevant ones and summarize the rest.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Describe any cleaning you had to do for your data.
<ul>
<li>You <em>must</em> include a link to your <code>load_and_clean_data.R</code> file.</li>
<li>Also, describe any additional R packages you used outside of those covered in class.</li>
<li>Describe and show code for how you combined multiple data files and any cleaning that was necessary for that.</li>
<li>Some repetition of what you do in your <code>load_and_clean_data.R</code> file is fine and encouraged if it helps explain what you did.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Organization, clarity, cleanliness of the page
<ul>
<li>Make sure to remove excessive warnings, use clean easy-to-read code (without side scrolling), organize with sections, use bullets and other organization tools, etc.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
