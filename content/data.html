<p>Your first steps in this project will be to find data to work on.</p>
<p>I recommend trying to find data that interests you and that you are knowledgeable about. A bad example would be if you have no interest in video games but your data set is about video games. I also recommend finding data that is related to current events, social justice, and other areas that have an impact.</p>
<p>You are <strong>not</strong> allowed to work on COVID data.</p>
<p>Initially, you will find <em>one dataset</em> but later you will need to combine that data with another dataset. For this reason, I recommend finding data that has some date and/or location components. These types of data are conducive to interesting visualizations and analysis and you can also combine this data with other data that also has a date or location variable.
Data from the census, weather data, economic data, are all relatively easy to combine with other data with time/location components.</p>
<div id="on-this-page" class="section level2">
<h2>On this page</h2>
<p>You will</p>
<ul>
<li>Describe where/how to find data.
<ul>
<li>You must include a link to the original data source(s).</li>
<li>Why was the data collected/curated? Who put it together? (This is important, if you donâ€™t know why it was collected then that might not be a good dataset to look at.}</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Describe the different data files used and what each variable means.
<ul>
<li>If you have many variables then only describe the most relevant ones and summarize the rest.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Describe any cleaning you had to do for your data.
<ul>
<li>You <em>must</em> include a link to your <code>load_and_clean_data.R</code> file.</li>
<li>Also, describe any additional R packages you used outside of those covered in class.</li>
<li>Describe and show code for how you combined multiple data files and any cleaning that was necessary for that.</li>
<li>Some repetition of what you do in your <code>load_and_clean_data.R</code> file is fine and encouraged if it helps explain what you did.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Organization, clarity, cleanliness of the page
<ul>
<li>Make sure to remove excessive warnings, use clean easy-to-read code (without side scrolling), organize with sections, use bullets and other organization tools, etc.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
